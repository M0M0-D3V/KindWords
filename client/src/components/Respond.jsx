        you've got options!

        If you don't really understand their problem, maybe you can make them
        feel better just by replying with a sympathy or solidarity?
      </p>

        If it's something you can relate to, maybe they'd like to hear how you
        handled it or just how you felt about it.

        People might not even be asking for answers, they just want to vent and
        be heard. And that is ok!
